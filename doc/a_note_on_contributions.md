### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Summary: Our project developed a Shiny App with information about COVID-19 in US regarding to economical circumstances for small businesses. Our data is from both JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data and Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker Data (listed above). In particular, we further analyzed metrics about small businesses including affinity of consumer, revenue and merchant of small businesses, and indicators about COVID-19 including 4 categories of cases and 3 categories of rates corresponding to different states in US. COVID-19 has dramatically altered everyone's life pattern and this app could provide everyone in US with information about pandemic situation. Moreover, this app is also aimed to help local small business owners so that they could gather some useful information here in order to formulate future business strategies and improve their future operating conditions. We hope to support everyone in US especially for small business owners. Together, we're relentlessly fighting COVID-19!
