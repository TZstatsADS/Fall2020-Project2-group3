In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using [JHU CSSE Covid-19 Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- study legacy codes and further development

+ Shiny Link:

+ Additional Source of Dataset: We used [Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/douglaskgaraujo/opportunity-insights-real-time-economic-tracker-us?select=data) This dataset is created as part of Opportunity Insights' Economic Tracker, which you can access directly (and with a very nice user interface) at (https://www.tracktherecovery.org) 

Here is also a related documentation:
"How Did COVID-19 and Stabilization Policies Aﬀect Spending and Employment? A New Real-Time Economic Tracker Based on Private Sector Data", by Raj Chetty, John Friedman, Nathaniel Hendren, Michael Stepner, and the Opportunity Insights Team. June 2020. Available at: https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf

+ **Project summary**: Our project developed a Shiny App with information about COVID-19 in US regarding to economical circumstances for small businesses. Our data is from both JHU CSSE COVID-19 Data and Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker Data (listed above). In particular, we further analyzed metrics about small businesses including affinity of consumer, revenue and merchant of small businesses, and indicators about COVID-19 including 4 categories of cases and 3 categories of rates corresponding to different states in US. COVID-19 has dramatically altered everyone's life pattern and this app could provide everyone in US with information about pandemic situation. Moreover, this app is also aimed to help local small business owners so that they could gather some useful information here in order to formulate future business strategies and improve their future operating conditions. We hope to support everyone in US especially for small business owners. Together, we're relentlessly fighting COVID-19!
